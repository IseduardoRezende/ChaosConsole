Am I the only one who finds this a bit philosophical and relaxing?

It's "organized" chaos

If you think about the galaxy, we are one of those little dots

Every blank space is an eternity away

I don't know, I like to imagine and play with these somewhat useless but philosophical things

What do you think?
